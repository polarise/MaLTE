Changes:
0.1-8:
03-09-2013
- Experimental: modified 'get.predictions()' to work on non-filtered tt.seq lists

0.1-7:
22-08-2013
- made 'get.predictions()' much faster using unlist( list, F, F ) and *apply functions instead of a for loop

17-08-2013
- fixed a bug that prevented 'get.predictions()' for transcript isoform expression with more than one isoform filtered (DONE)

0.1-6:
15-08-2013
- refactored 'prepare_txs_data.py'
- fixed a bug in the OOB filter function that prevented filtering of genes with single transcripts that didn't pass OOB
- added a feature to include transcript correlations in the rare event that both RNA-Seq and array data is available for test samples

16-08-2013
- fixed the above bug on filtering transcripts

0.1-5: 
14-08-2013
- refactored 'prepare_data.py'
- corrected stats produced by 'prepare_data.py'

0.1-4:
13-08-2013
- included parallel execution to create resource files used to build training and test data

0.1-3:
05-08-2013
- major fixes to documentation except documenting datasets




checklist:
- 80 characters
- comments
- replace 'NA' by NULL appropriately
- make sure user cannot enter samples.txt with samples that don't exist
- make sure that the return status of the python script are appropriately set under all conditions of either success or failure
- a data package?
- what if you try to filter and the other is not oob?
- consistency in show() methods for all classes
- handle warnings to do with correlation computations e.g. run( tt.ready.txs[[10]], tt.params )
- add keywords in the documentation
- replace 'T' with 'TRUE'

featurelist:
- leave-one-out cross-validation
- direct comparison to median-polish et al.
- add ComBat stuff
- make prepare_data parallel (DONE)


- later: provide a graphical description of which the best-performing probes are (i'm thinking of integrating the gene annotation model information together with a color-key-map that shows the reliablity of a probe in say a particular tissue)
